## Updating

If you've installed the Globalping CLI via a package manager, you only need to run the manager's update command to get the latest Globalping CLI version.

## Getting started with Globalping CLI

After installing, verify the Globalping CLI is working by running:

`globalping --help`

The result shows how to use the CLI and which commands and flags are available:

```
Usage:
  globalping [command]

Use "globalping [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Run your first tests

Globalping relies on a community-hosted probe network, enabling you to run network tests from any location with an active probe. The following examples show you through some tests, exploring how to define locations, set limits, and use some command flags.

#### Filter locations

For example, if you want to run ping from a probe in Seattle that is also part of the Comcast network, run the following:

```bash
globalping ping google.com from Comcast+Seattle
> Seattle (WA), US, NA, Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (AS33650)
PING  (142.250.217.78) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from sea09s29-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.217.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=58 time=14.0 ms
64 bytes from sea09s29-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.217.78): icmp_seq=2 ttl=58 time=14.5 ms
64 bytes from sea09s29-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.217.78): icmp_seq=3 ttl=58 time=15.9 ms

---  ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 402ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 13.985/14.779/15.886/0.807 ms
```

You can use the `+` symbol as a filter to select the desired location of the probes more precisely.

> [!TIP]
> You can mix and match any location type, including countries, continents, cities, US states, regions, ASNs, ISP names, eyeball or data center tags, and cloud region names.

#### Define multiple locations and basic flags

With the following command, we execute four ping commands at four different locations and obtain the summarized latency metrics for each test as a result:

```bash
globalping ping google.com from Amazon,Germany,USA,Dallas --limit 4 --latency
> Seoul, KR, AS, Amazon.com, Inc. (AS16509) (aws-ap-northeast-2)
Min: 33.163 ms
Max: 33.256 ms
Avg: 33.22 ms

> Frankfurt, DE, EU, DE, OVH SAS (AS16276)
Min: 1.221 ms
Max: 1.291 ms
Avg: 1.264 ms

> Chicago (IL), US, NA, Cogent Communications (AS174)
Min: 112.405 ms
Max: 112.686 ms
Avg: 112.528 ms

> Dallas (TX), US, NA, Catalyst Host LLC (AS393336)
Min: 1.579 ms
Max: 1.588 ms
Avg: 1.584 ms
```

You can select multiple locations for running a command by using a comma `,` as a delimiter. When doing so, make sure to also specify the number of tests to run with the `--limit` flag.
For example, to run ping from four different locations (as we did in the example above), add `--limit 4` to make sure you get one test result per location. Otherwise, the default limit of 1 will be selected, resulting in a random result from one of the four locations.

Finally, you can use the `--latency` parameter to only get the summarized latency data instead of the full raw output.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend reading our [tips and best practices](https://github.com/jsdelivr/globalping#best-practices-and-tips) to learn more about defining locations effectively!

#### Share results online

Include a link at the bottom of your results using the `--share` flag to view and share the test results online.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Shareable links and the respective saved measurement results expire after a few weeks, depending on the user type. GitHub Sponsors, for example, enjoy extended result storage.

```bash
 globalping dns google.com from gcp-asia-south1 --share
> Mumbai, IN, AS, Google LLC (AS396982) (gcp-asia-south1)

#### Reselect probes

You can select the same probes used in a previous measurement by passing the measurement ID to the `--from` flag.

```bash

#### Reselect probes from measurements in the current session

Use `[@1 | first, @2 ... @-2, @-1 | last | previous]` to select the probes from previous measurements in the current session.

```bash
globalping ping google.com from USA  --latency
> Ashburn (VA), US, NA, Hetzner Online GmbH (AS213230)
Min: 7.314 ms
Max: 7.413 ms
Avg: 7.359 ms

globalping ping google.com from Germany  --latency

```

#### Run continuous non-stop measurements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, this feature is limited to the ping command.

Use the `--infinite` flag to continuously ping a host, just like on Linux or MacOS. Although it appears as a single measurement, the Globalping API combines multiple measurements from the same probes into one output. As a result, the test will stop once you run out of credits.

Here's an example of running an infinite ping from a single probe:

```bash
globalping ping cdn.jsdelivr.net from Europe --infinite
> London, GB, EU, Psychz Networks (AS40676)
PING cdn.jsdelivr.net (151.101.1.229) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 151.101.1.229 (151.101.1.229): icmp_seq=1 ttl=59 time=0.54 ms
64 bytes from 151.101.1.229 (151.101.1.229): icmp_seq=2 ttl=59 time=0.42 ms
^C
```

If you define multiple probes to perform your infinite ping, the CLI output switches to summary mode, letting you compare the result data collected from all probes:

```bash
globalping ping cdn.jsdelivr.net from Europe --limit 5 --infinite
Location                                               | Sent |    Loss |     Last |      Min |      Avg |      Max
London, GB, EU, OVH SAS (AS16276)                      |   22 |   0.00% |  3.33 ms |  3.07 ms |  3.20 ms |  3.33 ms
Falkenstein, DE, EU, Hetzner Online GmbH (AS24940)     |   22 |   0.00% |  5.41 ms |  5.30 ms |  5.78 ms |  13.1 ms
Vienna, AT, EU, EDIS GmbH (AS57169)                    |   22 |   0.00% |  0.47 ms |  0.46 ms |  0.56 ms |  0.88 ms
Stockholm, SE, EU, The Constant Company, LLC (AS20473) |   22 |   0.00% |  1.03 ms |  0.83 ms |  1.15 ms |  4.66 ms
Madrid, ES, EU, EDGOO NETWORKS LLC (AS47787)           |   22 |   0.00% |  0.24 ms |  0.13 ms |  0.26 ms |  0.42 ms
^C
```

> [!TIP]
> Stop the infinite ping by pressing CTRL+C on your keyboard.

#### View your measurement history

You can view the history of your current session's measurements by running the `history` command.

```bash
globalping history
1 | 2024-03-27 11:56:46 | ping google.com
> https://www.jsdelivr.com/globalping?measurement=itcR65tYCqbouXib
- | 2024-03-27 11:57:01 | dns google.com from last
> https://www.jsdelivr.com/globalping?measurement=kWc5UBK9A6G4RUYM
2 | 2024-03-27 11:57:20 | traceroute google.com from New York --limit 2

```

> [!TIP]
> Use this command to get the measurement IDs needed to run a new measurement, which [reuses the probes](#reselect-probes) from a previous one.

#### Learn about available flags

Most commands have shared and unique flags. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with these so that you can run and automate your network tests in powerful ways.

Simply execute the command you want to learn more about with the `--help` flag:
